# Internstudio_taskno2
I am excited to share that I have completed my task2 during my internship with @internstudio! Number Guessing Game in Java!Developed an engaging game with Java, sharpening my problem-solving and coding skills.implements a simple number guessing game. Generate a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) and prompt users to guess the number. Provide feedback to users based on their guesses (e.g., too high, too low, correct guess). Allow users to continue playing until they guess the correct number or choose to quit the game.Looking forward to the next milestone!
